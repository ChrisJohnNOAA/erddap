* The problem - 
 In practice, there are many types of data servers and many client programs.
 This is a simplification:
   there are other types of servers,
   there are other clients
   there are plug-ins and libraries that provide other connections, 
 but this is the basic picture.

 Each data server arose to fulfill a need. 
 Each has at least one client that works with it.
 Each is great when paired with its client.

 But from a given clients point of view, the problem is that 
 you can't get data from most types of data servers.
 If a scientist using the netcdf libraries wants to get data 
 from an SOS server, well, good luck with that.
 Other connections work poorly 
 or require that the user install a new plug in or library.

 Users have and like *all* of these clients.  They aren't going away.
 New ones keep popping up (like GoogleEarth).
 NOAA can't issue a directive like "Everyone must use ArcGIS only."
 The ArcGIS users would be happy ("sweet!")
 but the Matlab users would say "you've got to be kidding!"

 We need a way for any client software to get data from any data server, 
 hopefully without a plug-in or library.





* ERDDAP is a pretty good (but not perfect) solution to the problem.
  In one fell swoop it solves the problem for most datasets,
  allowing almost any client software to get data from almost any data server.
  And users don't have to download and install any plug-ins or new software.

  ERDDAP is a program that runs on a web server.
  A request for data comes to ERDDAP, 
  ERDDAP converts the request to the data source's request format.
  The data comes back to ERDDAP (in some format).
  ERDDAP converts the data to the requested format.
   
  There is no new client software to install. 
  Users keep using their favorite client software.









* How?
  * By restricting the data model to 
    * same-size grids
      To give an example, if you have model output
      where some of the data variables are just for the surface
      and some of the data variables are available at various depths,
      then in ERDDAP, you have to split the dataset into two datasets
      at surface, at depths.
    * database-like tables, 
      which are good for in-situ and other database-like data.

  * Offering other file types:
    * OPeNDAP defines: 
       .dds for the dataset's structure, 
       .das for the dataset's metadata attributes,
       .html for a web page for selecting a subset of data
       .asc for the ASCII data
       .dods for the binary form of the data
    * Because ERDDAP has a simplified data model, 
      it can support lots of other file types: ...
      and even make images with maps or graphs.







* Plug-ins and Libraries

  Great if users want to use them (e.g., netcdf-java library)
  and already have them.
  They may be a great solution to a specific problem.

  The general disadvantages are:
  * Some users are reluctant to install plug-ins.
  * Some users don't have permission to install software.
  * Some users will have difficulty installing them.
  * Plug-ins may break when the application is updated.
    (And you have to maintain different versions of plug-in.)
  * If there is a new version of the plugin (e.g., with a bug fix), 
    it is impossible to get all users to update.

  Server-based software doesn't have those problems
  if it works with existing clients.








* Other features
  * Full text search (including metadata) for datasets 
  * Faceted search for datasets
  * Make A Graph 
  * Subset
  * Subscriptions - RSS, email, ping




* UAF erddap  and on Amazon EC2.
    
  







* Please install ERDDAP beside your current server
  * more efficient
  * about 20 institutions (inside and outside of NOAA) have installed it
  * clients will appreciate other options for searching for datasets
    and downloading subsets of data.





* Summary
  * Allows any client software to get data from any data server.
  * No new client software to install.
  * Catalog services.
  * Maps and graphs.
  * Subscriptions.
  * Try it. Install it next to your current data server.

* ERDDAP (the Environmental Research Division's Data Access Program) 
  * Is an OPeNDAP server (and more)
  * Serves data from local files and other data servers.
  * Lets users get data for their favorite client software
    without a new plugin or library.
