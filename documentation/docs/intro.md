# Documentation Intro

Documentation is grouped into categories focused on the types of activities that are covered. There's a section of docs for [server administrators](/docs/category/server-administration/), [project contributors](/docs/category/contributing/), and [users](/docs/category/user/).

We also have [javadoc for the Script classes](pathname:///javadoc/com/cohort/util/package-summary.html) that will be useful for those defining datasets.
